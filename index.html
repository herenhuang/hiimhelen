            <h3>Program Manager Intern at Microsoft (again!)</h3>
            <p class="exp_text">My second 16-week internship at Microsoft was on the Microsoft Edge Developer
                Ecosystem team.</p>
             <p class="exp_text">This was my first time not really being a feature PM - I'd categorize my role as leaning more towards
            developer marketing, technical evangelism, or a business-y PM. It involved a lot of market and audience
            research, and I did a bunch of cool stuff interviewing the founder of <a href="http://www.c-sharpcorner.com">C# Corner</a> and starring in my very own <a href="https://channel9.msdn.com/Blogs/msedgedev/Edge-14-overview">interview on Channel9.</a></p>
