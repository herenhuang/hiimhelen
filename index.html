            <p class="exp_text">My second 16-week internship at Microsoft was on the Microsoft Edge Developer
                Ecosystem team.</p>
             <p class="exp_text">This was my first time not really being a feature PM - I'd categorize my role as leaning more towards
            developer marketing, technical evangelism, or a business-y PM. It involved a lot of market and audience
            research, and I did a bunch of cool stuff interviewing the founder of <a class="reg_link" href="http://www.c-sharpcorner.com">C# Corner</a> and starring in my very own <a class="reg_link" href="https://channel9.msdn.com/Blogs/msedgedev/Edge-14-overview">interview on Channel9.</a></p>

            <h3>Program Manager Intern at Microsoft</h3>
            <p class="exp_text">My first internship at Microsoft Redmond was on the Windows Update Telemetry team.</p>
             <p class="exp_text">I got the quintessential product/program manager internship experience - shipped an internal product, went through research, design, development and post-implementation support phases. Learned some lessons on time management though - my dev, James, and I were stayed until 10PM some nights to finish it in time...</p>

             <p class="exp_text">My break into tech was a tough and rewarding 16 weeks in downtown Toronto. I familiarized myself with SQL, designed & shipped two critical p1 features on iOS and Android, and saw my app rise from 1 star to 4 stars on the App store.</p>

            <p class="exp_text">Second bank internship meant diving deeper into data analysis (and testing!).</p>
             <p class="exp_text">As this was my second internship in a similar environment, I had a lot more opportunity to expand my knowledge with additional responsibilities. This included the generation of reports to higher management, as well as being introduced to manual and automated testing within IST, UAT and PROD environments.</p>

            <p class="exp_text">After 200+ applications on our school's job board, I landed a gig!</p>
             <p class="exp_text">This was my first "real" job, digitalizing hand-drawn diagrams via Visio, creating and working with an automated Gantt Chart, and getting accustomed to corporate culture. Being part of the CIBC Co-op Social Committee, I also revamped the monthly intern calendar and ran networking events.</p>
